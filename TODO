Controller should allow:
Turn strip on/off (button on, button off)
change colors (allow presets) (15 presets - R G B W, then shades of each (mathematically decide))
increase/decrease brightness (up and down buttons; ALSO WORK to increase/decrease speed if held of effects))
varios effects (flash=fast rainbow change, strobe=slower, , fade=fast fade, smooth=slow fade, chase='chasing' fade; )
